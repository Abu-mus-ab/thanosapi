# Thanos Quotes API!

Built using ExpressJS framework in NodeJS.

## Endpoints:

### Grab a random Thanos quote!
[https://thanosapi.herokuapp.com/random/](https://thanosapi.herokuapp.com/random/)

### Grab a specified number of random Thanos quotes!
[https://thanosapi.herokuapp.com/random/&lt;integer&gt;/](https://thanosapi.herokuapp.com/random/5/)

### Grab all Thanos quotes!
[https://thanosapi.herokuapp.com/all/](https://thanosapi.herokuapp.com/all/)

## How these quotes were collected

Googled thanos quotes and wrote a python script through which I could just input a quote and it will automatically form json with correct id and append it to the quotes file.

## Make a contribution!

Would love to make the api better and more efficient if someone is willing to help. Also if I missed a thanos quote, submit a Pull Request, with the quote added to the quotes/quotes.js file.
